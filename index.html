	<pre> Sample dummy google text to test page break length 
		Analytical 

What: I had got to work for Ax account. In that, every section had a logical / conditional parameters. I had to develop UI based on such parameters. Complex informations were needed to be analiyzed.

How: I analized complex information of bank. I had broken complete structure into sub sections. Then conditions were applied after analyzing complex information. 

Result:  As of result, application flow was sucessful. Testing was done using complex information. Application build was successful.


Learning

What: Many projects have large number of sections and linked pages. To develop these lot of css is used to stylize web pages and large scripts are used to make these behave dynamic as per requirements.  Imrovement was needed to reduce time and efforts to develop these projects.

How: I improved me with latest advance technologies like SCSS (a CSS preprocessor) to write fast css stylesheets. To make pages dynamic, used Jquery for faster development with very less code.

Result: With this improvement, large repititive stylesheets need not to be written repititive styles. Using SCSS I have made functions which can be called many times as required to reduce efforts and time. Jquery made it easier to develop dynamic pages very fast and with less complexity of code. 


Orientation

What: Large number of customers' do business at International level. Many group projects keep running at the same time. Multiple teams work on different sections as per requirement. Their work relate to each other to take process further. To servicing in a better and fast way to customers, teams need to coordinate with each other and help to come out of stucks

How: Using my skills and experience, I suggested better ways to make process faster whether technologywise or processwise. To serve customers in more efficent way, I contributed in many ways like by helping to solve out complex issues which were stuck in work and tried to work faster and in better way and have got huge success in this.  

Result: As a result, project deliverables are completed on time and in better way. These contributions helped in many ways to sevicing customers better and better.


Building

I have been involved in team building in many projects. 
Recently I was involved in a large scale project. There was many teams were involved in the project. 
All teams were at different locations like Hyd, BBR and US. 
I was required to network with teams at various locations to get the information, tasks from BBR and Hyd teams and get it verified by other team at United location. So that project work could have been taken furher for completion. 

How: 
As many teams were involved in this. A common bridge number was shared
Meeting time for teams was also scheduled 
All required information, status and issues were discussed over this network. 

Result: 
I got information quickly whenever it was required to me for my work
Got updates from onsite team on project status and tasks
Teams were not needed to be at the same place
Networking with different teams, project could be handled successfully,
