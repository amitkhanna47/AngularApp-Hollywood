			"Hello and GM
I am Amit Khanna, my role in TSO is into the Ui Development, where I work as a UI developer role. "		
	When visual design is created, To make it render to browser, I code using HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Jquery etc.		
	Apart from that, I have completed my MCA from KUK 		
	Experience		
			
Presentation			
			
Analytical		Ree – Sachin Srivastava	
On Analytical ability, I'll be talking about recent event			
			
What exactly it was:			
1	ECommerce website		
2	Project was created long time back when I was inducted in the project team		
3	There were change requests coming, on which we had to work		
4	"When we tried to change, It was taking 5-8 hours to make single change 
Irrespective of complexity level medium, low, high"		
5	Because we could not relate change requests to the existing code because		
6	complex css styling		
7	Improper html architect / repeated		
8	I had to optimize the code		
			
How did I solve it			
1	Analyised code and observed		
	i) multiple containers for a single element	Div > tablle > div > div > p	
	ii) repeated css classes for a single style	.red , .styleRed, .h1.red	
	ii) Additionally inline css, which is given within elements	explain about inline ??	
	iii) Also inline css was repeated for same type of elements	"<header style=underline> 
     <text style=underline>  text </text>"	
	iv) inline styles needs to rewrite in other pages		
			
2	collected this information and documented it		
3	simplyfied the hirerchy by removing unnecessary containers		
4	made external stylesheet		
5	removed outdated attributes		
			
Result			
1	We can call style from 1 external file n number of times		
2	I used related css naming convention according to element type	.header  inseatd of .section1	
3	Less repetition, less efforts	.red	
4	Now 1-3 hours to change instead of 5-8 hours		
5	Anyone can understand easily because well structured		
6	Validated by W3C		
			
			
			
			
LEARNING & INNOVATION		WCR – Pradipta Kumar Das – BBR	
			
What was it:			
1	80 templates		
2	Complex UX design		
3	HTML5 and CSS3 was to be used		
4	"To add to our challenges, given time was less. 
We estimated minimum 30 days for it"		
5	"But in client and project manager meeting 
Given time was 20 days"		
6	With normal CSS writing it was quite difficult 		
			
			
How			
1	I googled to find a way by which we could write css in lesser time		
2	I found two different techs SCSS and LESS		
3	I give an example of SCSS usage	Normal CSS	"Header > link1 style red, 
Header > link2 style red"
		SCSS	Header > link1 and link2 style red
4	Other compex things can be achieved by SCSS		
5	I gone though lot of articles		
6	I created POC using all different complexity in pages		
7	Showed to PM that this has been created in very less time		
8	got approval from PM to use it in entire pages		
			
Result			
1	Coding time was reduced to 60%		
2	All styling was done in 18 days, before short timelines		
3	This way I learned new tech 		
4	I did innovation and used this tech in new project		
			
			
			
			
CUSTOMER ORIENTATION		Help while in wcr for DPG – Chandan	
			
What was it:			
1	I had just finished one project of Amex		
2	All functionalities were integrated and my role was completed		
3	I was released & took into another project of Amex Group		
4	After these functionalities, client wanted some limited functionalities to be added		
	i) Data sortings		
	ii) searching		
	iii) Date pickers / calenders		
	iv) documentation editor		
5	Since I was released, PM tried to utilize current team		
6	"But team was stuck due to some challenges and complexities 
Like calender popups and sorting etc"		
7	PM approcahed me if I could guide them to implement change requests		
			
How			
1	I needed to take my current PM approval		
2	Since my current project had tight timeslines		
3	Rather than putting current project into risk		
	I checked with last PM, if his team could come on weekend		
4	I came on weekend		
5	Knew their issues, mistakes they were doing		
6	I guided them in implementing functionalities, 		
7	Provided examples what should be done, how should be done		
			
Result			
1	Team came out of the issues, they were facing		
2	Client work was completed without any difficulty		
	Without additonal UI developer which was required		
3	It benefited business of the client by getting these additional change requets done		
4	Client was happy with this efforts and service		
			
			
BUILDING TEAMS		DPG new portal design	
			
What was it:			
1	In this, not as a Lead role, but in this I'll tell how I shared my knowledge with different teams		
2	Client was not happy because 		
	Design which was created was not supporting to multiple devices and browsers		
	for an example		
	i) buttons created were supported by new browsers using html5 and css3 but not in older browsers like IE7		
  	ii) Stylish scrollbars were used in design, but those could not be handled in all browsers		
	     because some browsers supports only their own default scrollers		
	iii) some other functionalities were also there in design, which could not be made cross browser		
3	"Since I am expert in UI development part, client and onsite team thought I could explain better to design team 
About all these requirements"		
			
			
			
			
How did I solve it			
1	I connected with onsite team and got all requirements		
2	I analyzed the created design 		
3	I listed all things like what could be challenges while implementation, browser supoortance etc 		
4	I fixed meeting and agenda with design team on this and		
5	connected with them and shared all information, status 		
			
Result			
1	All changes were suggested to design team over this call		
2	I suggested them to keep design elements simple and less weighted		
3	Design team worked according to requirement and suggestions 		
4	I updated on this to onsite people		
5	This way designs were made for cross browsers and devices
